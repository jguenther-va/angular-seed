### Project Setup TODOS
I did not want to overwrite some of the files generated by the cli. 
This should be kept as flexible as possible to allow us to harness basic cli generation in the future.
As a result some manual configuration still has to be done.
#### git
set up your git repo

#### jenkinsfile
update label name to be project name

#### tasks.py
add base project name

#### app.yaml
add service name

#### angular-cli.json
update project name, change outdir to target, change styles.css to styles.scss, change default style ext to scss

#### package.json
add @angular/material, update name to <project-name>

#### app.module.ts 
`import { MaterialModule } from '@angular/material';` to app.module and add MaterialModule to list of imports



### Build Commands
#### Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

#### Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

#### Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `target/` directory. 
Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

#### Further help
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
